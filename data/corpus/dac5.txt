Vector Databases and Embeddings

Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors efficiently. They are essential for semantic search and RAG systems.

Embeddings are numerical representations of data (text, images, audio) in vector space. Similar items have similar vector representations, measured by distance metrics like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance.

Popular vector databases:
- Pinecone (cloud-based)
- ChromaDB (embedded)
- Weaviate (open-source)
- Milvus (scalable)
- FAISS (Facebook's library)

Vector search (also called semantic search) finds items based on meaning rather than
