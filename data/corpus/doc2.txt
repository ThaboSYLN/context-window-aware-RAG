Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks in animal brains. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers: an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.

Deep learning refers to neural networks with multiple hidden layers. These deep networks can learn hierarchical representations of data, making them particularly effective for complex tasks like:
- Computer vision (identifying objects in images)
- Speech recognition
- Natural language understanding
- Game playing (like AlphaGo)

Training neural networks involves adjusting connection weights through backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize prediction errors.
