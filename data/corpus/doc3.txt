Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing is a field of AI focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. NLP combines computational linguistics with machine learning and deep learning.

Key NLP tasks include:
- Text classification (spam detection, sentiment analysis)
- Named entity recognition (identifying people, places, organizations)
- Machine translation (translating between languages)
- Question answering
- Text summarization
- Language generation

Modern NLP relies heavily on transformer architectures like BERT, GPT, and T5, which use attention mechanisms to process text more effectively than previous approaches.
