Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG is a technique that combines information retrieval with language generation. Instead of relying solely on knowledge encoded in model weights, RAG systems retrieve relevant information from external knowledge sources before generating responses.

The RAG process:
1. User submits a query
2. System converts query to vector embedding
3. Retrieval system finds similar documents using vector search
4. Retrieved documents are added to the language model's context
5. Model generates response using both its training and retrieved information

Benefits of RAG:
- Access to up-to-date information
- Reduced hallucinations
- Ability to cite sources
- Smaller models can perform better with good retrieval
